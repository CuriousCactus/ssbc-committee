# ssbc-committee

Takes the users in this year's committee from the ssbc_committee table and puts them into a group with enhanced viewing permissions using the Groups plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/). Makes a shortcode, [committee], which inserts a table and a JavaScript dropdown menu which allows viewing of present and past committees.
